  docket: "Police Report from Balsa County PD:\nSuspect was seen walking down the
    street humming a song about following some animal wherever he or she may go.
    It\u2019s unclear at the time if it was just an unfortunate coincidence, or if
    the suspect was, in fact, following Ms. Koala, but witnesses state that Mr. Koala
    appeared to be duck into alleys or behind trash cans whenever Ms. Koala turned
    around."
