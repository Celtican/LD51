  docket: 'Witness Statement:

    "I saw Ms. Lizard talking to Mr. Turtle when grabbed
    her purse and yanked out her wallet. When Ms. Lizard demanded to see the manager
    and have him detained, most animals turned away, not wanting to deal with her
    screeching voice. But I saw him take her wallet. This Karen definitely had a
    reason to complain."'
