  docket: 'Police Report from Balsa County PD:

    Mr. Turtle is  a key witness
    in another ongoing case. The red paint on his shell is key evidence for this
    case and, in fact, originated from an ink spill at a busted stop light, not from
    a car. The hue doesn''t even match the red pain on Ms. LIzard''s car.'
